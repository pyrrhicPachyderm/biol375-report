\section*{Introduction}

\section*{Methods}

Ten waterways around the Cass region of Canterbury, New Zealand were selected for the study.
Five were braided rivers, highly disturbed.
The other five were more stable spring-fed streams.
To confirm this intuition, we assessed the Pfankuch Stability Score of each stream \parencite{pfankuch, pfankuch-doc}.
The Pfankuch scores of the ten streams divided them clearly into a stable and unstable cluster, exactly as predicted (Figure \ref{fig:regressions}).
As such, we remained confident in treating stability categorically through the permutational tests.

At each waterway, a kick net sample of macroinvertebrates was taken.
Sampling occurred at five points inside each stream, selected by eye to be as diverse as possible within the reach.
All five samples per stream were combined in the same net.
Samples were bagged with water and live-picked later the same day.

To keep sampling time reasonable, abundances were recorded semi-quantitatively according to the same coded-abundance categories as use in calculating \possessivecite{sqmci} Semi-Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index:
0, 1--4, 5--19 and 20--99 (nothing above this range was observed).
Stoneflies, mayflies and caddisflies were resolved to the genus level; other taxa were resolved between the phylum and genus level, as far as possible.

To examine the effect of stream stability upon $\alpha$-diversity, we performed two linear regressions: taxonomic richness and total coded abundance of each stream as a function of the Pfankuch Stability Score.

For the remainder of the analyses, a dissimilarity was calculated between each pair of sites.
To make full use of the collected semi-quantitative (ordinal, partially ranked) data, we use the Hausdorff extension of an edit distance metric, as developed by \textcite{critchlow} and recommended by \textcite{dissimilarity-partially-ranked}.
In particular, we used Kendall's tau, reasoning that ecological gradients were more likely to cause shifts in the relative abundances of species than immediate wholesale removals (as in Ulam's metric) or substitutions (as in Hamming's distance).
%TODO: Address concerns from dissimilarity-partially-ranked about using low values as much as high values: we won't fall on both dies of the mode as we seem to have a linear gradient (no IDH).

From the metric distance matrix, we created an ordination plot using classical multidimensional scaling.
We tested for differences in community composition between the disturbed and stable streams using a permutational multivariate ANOVA, and for differences in community dispersion using \possessivecite{permdisp2} permutation test.
These analyses were performed using \texttt{R}, with the \texttt{vegan} package \parencite{vegan} for the permutation tests.

%TODO: GitHub

\section*{Results}

As the stability of the studied streams increased (as the Pfankuch score decreased), there was a clear, monotonic, more than two-fold increase of both macroinvertebrate abundance (\inputresults{abundance-regression}) and taxonomic richness (\inputresults{richness-regression}) (Figure \ref{fig:regressions}).
%TODO: Report the correct things for a Poisson regression.
