\section*{Introduction}

The relationship between disturbance and biodiversity is an important but hotly contested topic in ecology.
The intermediate disturbance hypothesis posits that biodiversity will highest with an intermediate level of disturbance: too much disturbance is unsurvivable for most species, but too little leads to a small handful of species competitively excluding all other \parencite{idh-original}.
Since its original formulation, the hypothesis has been subject to innumerable studies \parencite{disturbance-diversity-predict-test}.
Great swathes of evidence have fallen both in support of and against it, and recent papers have called for both its abandonment \parencite{idh-abandon} and its more widespread use \parencite{idh-patch-dynamics}.

Even in studies of very similar systems, New Zealand freshwater macroinvertebrates, results have differed.

\section*{Methods}

Ten waterways around the Cass region of Canterbury, New Zealand were selected for the study.
Five were braided rivers, highly disturbed.
The other five were more stable spring-fed streams.
To confirm this intuition, we assessed the Pfankuch Stability Score of each stream \parencite{pfankuch, pfankuch-doc}.
The Pfankuch scores of the ten streams divided them clearly into a stable and unstable cluster, exactly as predicted (Figure \ref{fig:regressions}).
As such, we remained confident in treating stability categorically through the permutational tests.

At each waterway, a kick net sample of macroinvertebrates was taken.
Sampling occurred at five points inside each stream, selected by eye to be as diverse as possible within the reach.
All five samples per stream were combined in the same net.
Samples were bagged with water and live-picked later the same day.

To keep sampling time reasonable, abundances were recorded semi-quantitatively according to the same coded-abundance categories as use in calculating \possessivecite{sqmci} Semi-Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index:
0, 1--4, 5--19 and 20--99 (nothing above this range was observed).
Stoneflies, mayflies and caddisflies were resolved to the genus level; other taxa were resolved between the phylum and genus level, as far as possible.

To examine the effect of stream stability upon $\alpha$-diversity, we performed two generalised linear regressions: taxonomic richness and total coded abundance of each stream as a function of the Pfankuch Stability Score.
Due to the count nature of the data and under- and over-dispersion in a Poisson regression, we use a quasi-Poisson regression.

For the remainder of the analyses, a dissimilarity was calculated between each pair of sites.
To make full use of the collected semi-quantitative (ordinal, partially ranked) data, we use the Hausdorff extension of an edit distance metric, as developed by \textcite{critchlow} and recommended by \textcite{dissimilarity-partially-ranked}.
In particular, we used Kendall's tau, reasoning that ecological gradients were more likely to cause shifts in the relative abundances of species than immediate wholesale removals (as in Ulam's metric) or substitutions (as in Hamming's distance).
%TODO: Address concerns from dissimilarity-partially-ranked about using low values as much as high values: we won't fall on both dies of the mode as we seem to have a linear gradient (no IDH).

From the metric distance matrix, we created an ordination plot using classical multidimensional scaling.
We tested for differences in community composition between the disturbed and stable streams using a permutational multivariate ANOVA, and for differences in community dispersion using \possessivecite{permdisp2} permutation test.
These analyses were performed using \texttt{R}, with the \texttt{vegan} package \parencite{vegan} for the permutation tests.

\section*{Results}

According to the Pfankuch scores, the sampled waterways ran nearly the full gamut of stability.
The score ranges from 38 to 152, and the sampled streams ranged from 47 to 125.
Stable streams always exhibited abundant macrophyte life, while the unstable waterways, the braided rivers, had essentially no vegetation below the upper banks.

26 different taxa were observed in total, many in only one stream and some only once.
One taxon, however, the mayfly genus \spbinom{Deleatidium}, was present in every stream sampled.

%TODO: More general observations.
%Abundance and richness? Or just point to the figure for these?

As the stability of the studied streams increased (as the Pfankuch score decreased), there was a clear, monotonic, more than two-fold increase of both macroinvertebrate abundance (\inputresults{abundance-regression}) and taxonomic richness (\inputresults{richness-regression}) (Figure \ref{fig:regressions}).
%TODO: Report the correct things for a Poisson regression.

The site ordination is shown Figure \ref{fig:site-ordination}.
There was no difference in community dispersion between the stable and the disturbed streams (\inputresults{permdisp}), but the community compositions differed significantly (\inputresults{permanova}).
%TODO: Report the correct things for PERMANOVA and PERMDISP.
